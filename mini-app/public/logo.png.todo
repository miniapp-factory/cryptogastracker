A stylized, modern logo for a crypto gas fee tracker app named “GasPulse”. The background is a deep navy blue gradient that fades from dark blue at the top to a slightly lighter blue at the bottom. In the center, a bold, white, sans‑serif wordmark reads “GasPulse” in a slightly italicized, futuristic font. Below the wordmark, a simple, stylized gas pump icon is rendered in white: a vertical cylinder with a small nozzle at the top, and a subtle glow effect around the nozzle to suggest motion. The overall composition is clean, minimalistic, and conveys speed and technology, suitable for a mobile and web app icon.
